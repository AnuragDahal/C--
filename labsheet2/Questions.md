# Programming Exercises

## Exercise 1: Structure to Hold a Date

### Problem
Write a program to set a structure to hold a date (mm, dd, and yy), assign values to the members of the structure, and print out the values in the format 11/28/2004 by function. Pass the structure to the function.

## Exercise 2: Function Overloading to Convert Feet to Inches

### Problem
Write a program using function overloading that converts feet to inches. Use functions with no arguments, one argument, and two arguments. Use pass by reference in any one of the functions above.

## Exercise 3: Namespaces for Square and Cube

### Problem

Define two namespaces: Square and Cube. 
In both the namespaces, define an integer variable named "num" and a function named "fun". The "fun" function in the "Square" namespace should return the square of an integer passed as an argument while the "fun" function in the "Cube" namespace should return the cube of an integer passed as an argument. In the main function, set the integer variables "num" of both the namespaces with different values. Then, compute and print the cube of the integer variable "num" of the "Square" namespace using the "fun" function of the "Cube" namespace and the square of the integer variable "num" of the "Cube" namespace using the "fun" function of the "Square" namespace.


## Exercise 4: Pass Temperatures by Reference

### Problem
Write a function that passes two temperatures by reference and sets the larger of the two numbers to a value entered by the user by using return by reference.

## Exercise 5: Inline Function for Employee Salary

### Problem
Assume that an employee will have to pay 10 percent income tax to the government. Ask the user to enter the employee salary. Use an inline function to display the net payment to the employee by the company.

## Exercise 6: Salary Increment for 2010

### Problem
Write a program that displays the current monthly salary of the chief executive officer, information officer, system analyst, and programmer that has been increased by 9, 10, 12, and 12 percentages respectively in the year 2010. Let us assume that the salaries in the year 2009 are:
- Chief executive officer: Rs. 35000/m
- Information officer: Rs. 25000/m
- System analyst: Rs. 24000/m
- Programmer: Rs. 18000/m

Make a function that takes two arguments; one salary and the other increment. Use a proper default argument.
